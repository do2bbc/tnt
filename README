Note: This is release of TNT 1.9, originally developed by Mark Wahl.
This release is the work of several people. Take a look in ./doc/CHANGES
for more information.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
QUICK-INSTALLATION, please read carefully

To install TNT:
  1) Type "./configure --help" to see the options you may be want to
     change (for example sound-support is defaultly compiled in).
  2) Type "./configure" or "./configure --[ARGS]" to configure TNT.
     (For example "./configure --disable-sound" to compile TNT without
     sound).
  3) Type "make" to build TNT.
  4) Type "make install" to install TNT.
  5) Good Luck ;-)

To uninstall TNT:
  1) Type "make uninstall" to uninstall TNT.
     You don't want to do this I think ;-) If you do, all files which were
     installed (and only these) will be deleted.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Configure-Options:
  There are five options for TNT:
  a) sound
  b) ax25k
  c) dpboxt
  d) hibaud (only supported on linux-systems)
  e) genuser

 Defaultly only sound and english is activated.
 To disable sound: ./configure --disable-sound
 To enable ax25k:  ./configure --enable-ax25k   (or --enable-ax25k2)
 To enable hibaud: ./configure --enable-hibaud
 To enable newuser:./configure --enable-newuser
 To enable dpboxt: ./configure --enable-dpboxt
 (Note: the dpbox-terminal is broken at the moment, so compilation with
        DPBOXT will fail!
  Note2: DPBOXT will disappear in further versions, so use an old TNT
         version, or wait for a new console, I will write if I have the
         time to do so ;-)

 Language: actually TNT supports
 -en = english
 -de = Deutsch
 -fr = french
 
 Enable your language with option "--with-language=xx", where xx is one of
 en, de, fr.

If your system does not include gettext, you should at the option
"--with-included-gettext" to ./configure (mostly older or non-GNU systems).
 
AX25-kernel support:
If you want to use TNT with ax25-kernel support, the only thing to do, is
configuring TNT with ax25k enabled.
Please Note: you MUST have the axutils installed. TNT needs the ax25lib
(libax25.a) and the include-files (there should exists in /usr/include/ax25
for example). TNT searches for an include-dir named "ax25".
If you compiled axutils, there must be a library "libax25.a". copy this file
to /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib and run "ldconfig", so TNT can find this lib.

With newer AX25-libs, you should use "--enable-ax25k2" instead of
"--enable-ax25k"

Please also read AX25-NOTES

HIBAUD:
Enable this, if you using a baudrate >38400 to your TNC. (Only supported on
Linux).

NEWUSER:
Use this carefully. Generation of newusers it disable by default, because it
is to unsecure. If you really want to use it, use this configure-option.
Because of this, some things have changed in tnt.ini, so take a look at
"tnt.ini" in examples-dir.

Installation is easy: "./configure", "make" and "make install".
After the installation is finished the program "tnt_setup" will be called.
Here you can do some important settings for your tnc, boxsocket or your
callsign. If you do not want this, just leave the program.

INSTALL-LOCATIONS:
------------------
If you do not want to install in /usr/[local/]... and /var, you should
call ./configure with --prefix= AND --localstatedir=

For example: if you want to put TNT completly in your homedirectory under tnt
use:
./configure --prefix=~/tnt --localstatedir=~/tnt [--other-options...]

For a really flat installation you can now use the --enable-flat option
while configuring. Just set $prefix and activate --flat.
For example: if you want to put TNT completly into /usr/local/tnt, just use:
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/tnt --enable-flat [--other-options...]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT:
TNT can now used by more than one user. Just install TNT as normal, and
than create a dir ".tnt" in your homedirectory and put ALL the Configuration-
files in it (tnt.ini and the *.tnt files).

If you don't start TNT with a given directory explizit (with the -i option),
TNT will search "tnt.ini" (or ".tntrc") in these places:
First in your $HOME/.tnt directory, e.g.  /home/you/.tnt/tnt.ini
Then in the current directory.
After this TNT will look in the directory you installed TNT in (Note: the
path in configure.h "TNT_INSTALL_PATH" will be hardcoded into TNT).
At last TNT looks in /etc/tnt.ini

The same thing is the "tntc.ini" (or ".tntrc"),
---------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW IN THIS VERSION: READ CAREFULLY!

Some start-options of TNT have been changed, so it is possible that tnt
won't start, because of a wrong tnt.ini.
Maybe you should comment out the lines for new_user generation and the
line for tnt_user_dir.
Take a deep look at "tnt.ini" in example-dir, to figure out all of the
changes.
